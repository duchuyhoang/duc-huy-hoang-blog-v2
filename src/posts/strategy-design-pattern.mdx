Hello folks, today I would like to introduce to you a design pattern : `Strategy Pattern`
Imaging you are doing a choosing transport service for a food app, a delivery app or any app that need to choose transportation.
So how do you do it ? If we don't do it well ,afterwards client need to add another transportation to our app , so the transfort logic will be bigger.
It's not what we want, and also we are not talking about extensibility of our application.
So `Strategy Pattern` will be our savior.

- Interface `Strategy` is our mold for any concrete class which implements it. Focus on the `execute` method , this function will be use
  to execute our main action. You can change this interface by using a `Abstract Class`.
- `ConcreteStrategyA`,`ConcreteStrategyB`,... or anything else whose implements interface `Strategy` need to define fully interface's properties and methods
- `Context` is where our code to be executed

{/* So let dive directly to our example: a Transportation selector function */}

- Interface `TravelStrategy` is `Strategy` base interface
- `PlaneStrategy`,`CarStrategy`,`MotorbikeStrategy` are `Concrete Class`
- `TransportContext` is `Context`

<Article id="strategyExampleImpletation" title="Sample Implementation">
Here is the implementation of above diagram
<div className="mt-4"></div>

```ts filename="strategy-example.ts"
interface Address {
  name: string;
  location: string;
}

abstract class TravelStrategy {
  public abstract doTransport(address: Address): any;
  constructor(protected name: string) {}

  public getName() {
    return this.name;
  }
}

class CarStrategy extends TravelStrategy {
  constructor(private carName: string) {
    super("car");
  }
  public doTransport(address: Address) {
    console.log(`Go to ${address.name} by ${this.carName}`);
  }
}

class MotorbikeStrategy extends TravelStrategy {
  constructor(private motorbikeName: string) {
    super("motorbike");
  }
  public doTransport(address: Address) {
    console.log(`Go to ${address.name} by ${this.motorbikeName}`);
  }
}

class PlaneStrategy extends TravelStrategy {
  constructor(private planeName: string, private type: string) {
    super("plane");
  }
  public doTransport(address: Address) {
    console.log(
      `Go to ${address.name} by ${this.planeName} with ticket type ${this.type}`
    );
  }
}

class TransportContext {
  private travelStrategiesMap: Map<string, TravelStrategy> = new Map();
  constructor() {}
  public addStrategy(strategy: TravelStrategy) {
    this.travelStrategiesMap.set(strategy.getName(), strategy);
  }

  public executeTransport(name: string, address: Address) {
    const selectingStrategy = this.travelStrategiesMap.get(name);
    if (selectingStrategy) {
      selectingStrategy.doTransport(address);
    }
  }
}

const holidayAddress: Address = {
  location: "xxxx",
  name: "Nha Trang",
};

const carTravel = new CarStrategy("Limousine");
const planeTravel = new PlaneStrategy("Boeing", "Merchant");

const motorbikeTravel = new MotorbikeStrategy("Wave");

const transporation = new TransportContext();

transporation.addStrategy(carTravel);
transporation.addStrategy(planeTravel);
transporation.addStrategy(motorbikeTravel);

transporation.executeTransport("car", holidayAddress);
transporation.executeTransport("plane", holidayAddress);
transporation.executeTransport("motorbike", holidayAddress);
```

<div className="mb-4"></div>
As you can see, my code is so simple ^^. In real project, we need to implement a
bunch of logics inside each `doTransport` method. So be patient, you'll have
chance to use it

So that's it my thoughts on `Strategy Pattern`.
This pattern is a very strong, intelligence, wonderful design pattern. If it was implemented the right way,
it will help us reduce a lots of effort while the changes happen.
Beside of that there is a famous authentication library have used `Strategy Pattern` as their coding strategy.
That is `PassportJS`, you can read it more from [`here`](https://www.passportjs.org/)
