On a beautiful day, I received an attractive ,wonderful, interesing ideal from nowhere üòÖ.
So yeah, I want to share my coding knowledges to everyone whose are reading this blog. You know , sharing knowledges
to other people is an another way to learn. Knowledges in the world are unlimited. When you are reading my post and yeah when you found
something wrong or something that is unreasonable, don't hesitate leave me a comment below the post üëá I'm would be very thankful if you would do it for me that ü§ó.

- I will share all my blog's using technologies in this post. So let dive right to it.

<div className="mt-4"></div>

<Article id="technologies" title="Technologies">

I'm a frontend developer, right ? So I will use some modern FE's framework for my blog. The important thing is my blog will be only
integrated with `Firebase` service. I don't use any other backend service for my blog.

<div className="mt-4"></div>
!['dependencies'](/how-i-build-this-blog/dependencies.png)

<Article id="technologiesNextjs" title="Nexjs">
  My blog is using Nextjs 14. Nextjs 14 has some strong functionalies like
  `Serve actions`, `Middleware`,... But unfortunately, I'm only using `CSR`. So
  my blog will be built into static site (only html). After that i will use
  static build folder to deploy into `Github`

<div className="mt-4"></div>

<Article id="technologiesTailwind" title="TailwindCSS">
Honestly I'm not a fan of TailwindCSS üòÜ. Because I think it's not fit for me.
I don't really like too long className, it will only make other coder hard to follow especially animation.
But you know Tailwind is a `CSS framework`, it's don't affect too much in logic, deploy,... And beside of that
my blog is my coding playground, I want to use another new technologies which I've never used before.

<div className="mt-4"></div>

</Article>

<Article id="technologiesGrayMatter" title="gray-matter">
So we have solved the post's content problem, but how about post's metadata ? As you can see in `Home` page,
each post have description, date created,... .Besides of that when you see at the top of any `.mdx` file there is a section start and end with `---` .
That is post's metadata

<div className="my-4">

</div>

So I'll write a function to extract post's raw content using `gray-matter` and just Nodejs `fs` module.

<div className="mt-4"></div>

```ts filename="index.ts"
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import matter from "gray-matter";
import { PostExtract, PostMetaData } from "@/types/post";

export const getMDXPostsDataAndMetaData = async (
  dir: string
): Promise<PostExtract[]> => {
  const postFileNames = await fs.readdirSync(dir);

  return postFileNames.map((fileName) => {
    const fileContent = matter(
      fs.readFileSync(path.join(dir.split("/").join("/"), fileName))
    );
    const metadata = matter(fileContent).data;

    return {
      id: fileName.split(".mdx")[0],
      metadata: metadata as PostMetaData,
      content: fileContent?.content,
    };
  });
};
```

<div className="mb-4"></div>

</Article>

<Article id="technologiesMdx" title="MDX">
Here is it, the star of the show belongs to `MDX`. I used this Markdown to write post ( you can read more of it from [`here`](https://mdxjs.com/) ).
As you can see, on the left of each section's title have a [`Chain icon`](#MDX). That is the magic of MDX, it can dip React's component inside MDX file, all
of the think you need is to pass the components you wish to `MDXRemote` component. Below is the implementation of Article's component üëá.

<div className="mt-4"></div>

```tsx filename="Article.tsx"
import Typography from "@/components/Typography";
import Link from "next/link";
import { FaLink } from "react-icons/fa";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

interface IArticleProps
  extends React.DetailedHTMLProps<
    React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>,
    HTMLElement
  > {
  id: string;
  title?: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

interface IArticleTitle {
  id: string;
  title: string;
}

const ArticleTitle = ({ id, title }: IArticleTitle) => {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center mb-2" title={title}>
      <Typography component="h5" className="text-[1.72rem] font-bold">
        <Link href={`#${id}`}>
          <FaLink
            size={"18px"}
            className="inline mr-2 dark:text-secondary-dark text-secondary rotate-[10deg] transition-all duration-500"
          />
        </Link>

        {title}
      </Typography>
    </div>
  );
};

const Article = ({
  title,
  id,
  children,
  className,
  ...rest
}: IArticleProps) => {
  const isSectionHaveTitle = !!title;
  return (
    <>
      <article
        title={title}
        id={id}
        className={twMerge("scroll-mt-[80px] my-4", className)}
        style={{
          scrollMarginTop: "80px",
        }}
      >
        {isSectionHaveTitle && <ArticleTitle id={id} title={title} />}

        {children}
      </article>
    </>
  );
};

export default Article;
```

<div className="mt-4">
  We import `Article` component and use it like this in `MDXRemote` component

  <div className="mt-4">
```tsx filename="MDXDetail.tsx"
  "use client";
import { MDXRemote, MDXRemoteProps } from "next-mdx-remote";
import Quote from "@/components/Quote";
import Typography from "../Typography";
import Article from "./Article";
import FullSizeImage from "@/components/FullSizeImage";
import CodeTag from "./Code";
import CodeBlock from "../CodeBlock";
import Divider from "../Divider";
import Img from "../Img";

import "./style.css";

export interface MDXDetailProps extends MDXRemoteProps {}

const components = {
p: Typography,
FullSizeImage: FullSizeImage,
Article: Article,
code: CodeTag,
pre: CodeBlock,
li: (props: any) => <Typography component="li" {...props} />,
hr: Divider,
img: Img,
Quote: Quote,
};

const MDXDetail = (props: MDXDetailProps) => {
return (

<MDXRemote {...props} components={components as any} />
);
};

export default MDXDetail;
````
</div>
</div>

<div className="mt-4"></div>- And implement like this in MDX file ‚û°Ô∏è will be complied
to what you are seeing
<div className="mb-4"></div>

```mdx filename="how-i-build-this-blog.mdx"
['nextjs'](/how-i-build-this-blog/mdx-remote.png)

<Article id="technologiesMdx" title="MDX">

<div className="mb-4"></div>

In order to generate all post's router I use will Nextjs [`Generating Static Params`]("https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#generating-static-params") technique.

In older version of Nextjs exacly before Nextjs 13.2 if we need to generateStaticPage you'll need to use 2 functions
[`getStaticProps`]('https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props')
and
[`getStaticPaths`]('https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-paths') together.
But right now Nextjs14 have a shorten generate static page function called [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#generating-static-params).
I'll use previous `getMDXPostsDataAndMetaData` combination with `generateStaticParams` and `getMDXPostsDataAndMetaData`. You can check this üëá

<div className="mt-4"></div>

```tsx filename="post/[id]/page.tsx"
import Container from "@/components/Container";
import { getMDXPostsDataAndMetaData } from "@/utils";
import fs from "fs";
import matter from "gray-matter";
import path from "path";
import { serialize } from "next-mdx-remote/serialize";
import rehypeMdxCodeProps from "rehype-mdx-code-props";
import { PostMetaData } from "@/types/post";
import PostDetailPage from "@/pages/PostDetail";
import remarkDirectives from "remark-directive";

const MDX_POST_DIR = path.join(process.cwd(), "src/posts");

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const datas = await getMDXPostsDataAndMetaData(MDX_POST_DIR);

  return datas.map((data) => ({
    id: data.id,
    slug: data.id,
  }));
}

const PostDetail = async ({ params }: any) => {
  const fileContent = matter(
    fs.readFileSync(path.join(MDX_POST_DIR, `${params.id}.mdx`))
  );

  const metadatas: PostMetaData = matter(fileContent).data as PostMetaData;

  const serializedDatas = await serialize(fileContent.content, {
    mdxOptions: {
      remarkPlugins: [remarkDirectives],
      rehypePlugins: [rehypeMdxCodeProps],
    },
  });

  return (
    <>
      <Container>
        <PostDetailPage
          metadata={metadatas}
          postDetailCompliedData={serializedDatas}
        />
      </Container>
    </>
  );
};

export default PostDetail;
```

<div className="mt-4"></div>- `rehypeMdxCodeProps` : Plugins support for Markdown's
codeblock. I can add more properties to it like `filename`,`showLine`

</Article>

<Article id="technologiesLunr" title="Lunr">
I use [`Lunr`]("https://lunrjs.com/guides/getting_started.html") for search's engine. Remember our extracted's post data above ?
Lunr support search with score so I will order score by field like this.
<div className="mt-4"></div>

```tsx filename="SearchBackDrop.tsx"
const index = useMemo(() => {
  return lunr(function (this) {
    this.field("tags", {
      boost: 4,
      extractor: (doc: any) => {
        return doc.metadata.tags;
      },
    });
    this.field("title", {
      boost: 3,
      extractor: (doc: any) => {
        return doc.metadata.title;
      },
    });
    this.field("description", {
      boost: 2,
      extractor: (doc: any) => {
        return doc.metadata.description;
      },
    });

    this.field("content");
    this.field("author", {
      extractor: (doc: any) => {
        return doc.metadata?.author?.name;
      },
    });
    this.ref("id");
    posts.forEach((post) => {
      this.add(post);
    });
  });
}, [posts]);

// Use Lunr's index like this
const searchResultsIds = index
  .search(`*${searchK}*`)
  .map((result) => result.ref);

// Set matched posts
setFilterPosts(posts.filter((post) => searchResultsIds.includes(post.id)));
```

<div className="mb-4"></div>

So the ideal is: I will pass all posts to a `React's Context` and use it in other component.
I know this have a very big drawback like if my page grow bigger, have more posts ‚û°Ô∏è the datas will be very big, we'll have
some posts that we don't really need. But like I have said, we don't have any backend service except `firebase` right ? So I will
migrate it later in other version. Right now please be happy with it üòÇ

<Article id="technologiesFramer" title="Framer Motion">
I use [`Framer Motion`](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animation.Why i choose it ? 
 Because it's a great library with a simple, short syntax. Easy to read and maintain, animation between two components was 
handled very `magic`

<div className="my-4">!['bg'](/how-i-build-this-blog/framer-motion.webp)</div>

<Article id="technologiesFirebase" title="Firebase">
I use some `Firebase` services in my website, such as [`Firebase Auth`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth), [`Firestore Datebase`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)
- `Firebase Auth` : Will be used for authentication ( Sign in with Google, Facebook,... )
- `Firestore Datebase` : I used it for post's comments function
But you know `Firebase` is not only having those services. It's have a lots of another services for you to explore, like [`Cloud Storage`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage)
